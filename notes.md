# Learning React By Myself

I though that some day I would have to learn this 'thing'. 
But meh, the laboral market is big for this 'technology', god knows why.

We are not doing the Quick Start, it's just not helpfull with my learning methods.

## Install

Since it's a web library we can just link the react js link in our html files and everything would be fine.
I'll see if there's any way to do it offline. But later. :)

### In a new project

Hey. React is a Library, if you want to creeate a new project, you can use a framework that uses ReactJS. 
Since you know, ReactJS IS A LIBRARY NOT A FRAMEWORK. Which let us use it in different context, with 
different tools and such.

Some of theese ReactJS based frameworks are:
- Next.js
    Simple ReactJS fullstack framework, perfect from small static webpages to big dynamic websites. 
    Which looks like it'll be my next pick if anything. Maintained by Vercel.
- Remix
    Another Fullstack with nested routing. Maintained by Shopify.
- Gatsby
    Flashing Fast for Content Management Systems, just like the ones used in technical configuration or
    enterprise enviroments. Maintained by Netlifly.
- Expo
    Framework which let us create native UIs for Android and IOs using a SDK for React Native which itself is 
    another thing that let you develop using ReactJS for Android and IOs but not nativily

Yeah, since it's a library you can still just use ReactJS, but React recomends the usage of a Framework, some reasons are:
Well in general the same problem multiple times which could be described with a sentence:
"Don't ReInvent the Wheel"
Some other arguments are the extra stability, community help, resources, tools and more.

### In a old project

Just add the library using the scripts link or add it using npm. Then use it.

## Development

Use generaly stuff like linters made for EmmaScript. Code editors like VSCode.
And shit like Prettier, yeah, right.

## Typescript 

By default Typescript can handle JSX scripts, but they dont throw and show any errors or warnings with types.
The solution to this is using a Typescript Playgorund, which I'll have to check later.

There's a bunch of functions and stuff that React has implemented typescript types. I'll check them later since I don't 
understand anything.

## React Development Tools

Special stuff for developers which let us debug and find performance issues. 
It can be installed as an browser extension. I can't find the extension code licence and 
general stuff like: Is Facebook trying to spy me? But in general, it looks "fine"

You can also install it with npm and link it with some localhost weird port.


With all of that Said, we can start learning React by themselfs. Although it might have been more usefull to use a framework, but heck
